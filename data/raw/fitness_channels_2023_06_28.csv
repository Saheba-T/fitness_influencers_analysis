Rebecca-Louise,"Hey, 

Welcome to #TEAMBURN üôåüèª 

I am so excited to have you working out with me! 

My community says that they ,Come for the workout and leave with a changed MINDSET!' ‚ö°Ô∏è

I'm Rebecca and after playing competitive sports growing up I have always had a love for exercise and being part of a team üí™üèª

I never knew what to do at the gym with all the equipment so I started to workout from home. I loved it so much that I started to share what I was doing & because I was finally seeing results! 

SUBSCRIBE to my channel for the new workouts posted every Monday 7am PST üîî 

We have a wide variety of workouts for all levels which means you never get bored!

Let's have some FUN, grow our mindsets, cheer each other on & be the best versions of ourselves.

In May of 2022 I climbed Mount Everest & I will be sharing my documentary here at the end of 2022.

Love, 
Rebecca
